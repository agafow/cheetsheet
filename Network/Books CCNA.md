#### Supplemental Resources  
In addition to the book you hold in your hands, I recommend three supplemental resources to  
augment your final 31 days of review and preparation.  
First is Scott Empson’s very popular CCNA 200-301 Portable Command Guide (ISBN: 9780135937822).  
This guide is much more than just a listing of commands and what they do.Yes, it summarizes all the  
CCNA certification-level IOS commands, keywords, command arguments, and associated prompts.  
It also provides you with tips and examples of how to apply the commands to real-world scenarios.  
Configuration examples throughout the book provide you with a better understanding of how these  
commands are used in simple network designs.  
Second, Kevin Wallace’s CCNA 200-301 Complete Video Course and Practice Test (ISBN: 9780136582755)  
is a comprehensive training course that brings Cisco CCNA exam topics to life through the use of  
real-world demonstrations, animations, live instruction, and configurations, making learning these  
foundational networking topics easy and fun. Kevin’s engaging style and love for the technology are  
infectious. The course also includes excellent practice tests.  
Third, Wendell Odom’s IP Subnetting LiveLessons (ISBN: 9780135497777) and IP Subnetting  
Practice Questions Kit (ISBN: 9780135647288) will help you master this crucial skill. Subnetting  
is not only an IPv4 address design skill, it is also crucial skill for troubleshooting situations where  
IPv4 addressing has been misconfigured. You are likely to have both types of questions on the  
CCNA exam
